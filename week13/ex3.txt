1. Make all the dining philosophers eat sequentially. Then the circular waiting condition will break and there will be no deadlock.

2. Make philosophers polite so that if no one of the philosophers can eat because he has only one fork some philosopher gives fork to another one. It will break non-preemption condition and the philosophers would be recovered from a deadlock.
