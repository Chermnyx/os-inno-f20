# The time it takes to copy the files is really small. Let's modify the code to include O_SYNC flag.

# The difference in all the cases is insignificant because i'm using NVME SSD and COW filesystem (so the actual copying is not performed).
# Theoretically, the copying should be faster for small files. For small files it doesn't metter what the buffer is because the file can fit in the buffer entirely. For big files bigger buffer makes copying faster.
