The output of Program 1:
```
Hello
Hello
```
The output of program 2:
```
Hello


```

The first program:
Puts "Hello" to it's output buffer
forks
Adds "\n" to the buffer and prints the content of the buffer.

The second program:
Puts "Hello\n" to the buffer and prints it
forks
Puts "\n" to the buffer and prints it (twice after fork)

In both cases the line buffer is used and it is flushed to the stdout after receiving "\n" character
